					Hi All 👋 I am Irshath. A Front-End developer, passionate to create
					experience on web. It all started when I was in final year of my
					college. I always wonder how the web works so I started learning web
					development, eventually it turns out to be my passion. After learning
					the basics of HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, I started learning React
					JS for creating UI.
				</p>

				<p className="p-styles mt-6">
					I was curious what are these "servers" How do they work. So I started
					learning NodeJS and got to know how to create APIs and stuff. I've
					created Rest APIs in ExpressJS. I describe myself as a Front-End
					developer who likes to create fast, smooth web apps which gives user a
					good experience. I'm familiar with JavaScript framework React, but I'm
					open to learn any other modern frameworks out there. I prefer to build
					TypeScript first application. And I use vim btw :){" "}
