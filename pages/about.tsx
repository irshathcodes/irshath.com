				Hi All ðŸ‘‹ I am Irshath. A Front-End developer, passionate to create
				experience on web. It all started when I was in final year of my
				college. I always wonder how the web works so I started learning web
				development, eventually it turns out to be my passion. After learning
				the basics of HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, I started learning React JS
				for creating UI.
			</p>

			<p className="p-styles mt-6">
				I was curious what are these "servers" How do they work. So I started
				learning NodeJS and got to know how to create APIs and stuff. I've
				created Rest APIs in ExpressJS. I describe myself as a Front-End
				developer who likes to create fast, smooth web apps which gives user a
				good experience. I'm familiar with JavaScript framework React, but I'm
				open to learn any other modern frameworks out there. I prefer to build
				TypeScript first application. And I use vim btw :){" "}
